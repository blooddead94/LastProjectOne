            <div class="second_txt">On January 21, the French National Data Protection Commission (CNIL) announced
                on
                its website that it had fined Google for violating the EU's General Data Protection Regulation
                (GDPR).
                It took six months for the EU countries to make a quality level-up in the amount of fines for
                non-compliance with this standard. Prior to that, the fine was mainly € 20,000-30,000, with the
                largest
                fine amounting to € 400,000 and related to a hospital in Portugal. But this precedent is interesting
                not
                so much the<br> amount of the fine as the rigidity of the regulator's approaches. Denis Beregovyi, Axon
                Partners, explains why, especially for Mind.<br><br>
                For what? The group complaints against Google arrived
                at CNIL on the same day that the GDPR came
                into
                force. The complainants reported that Google processed users' personal data without due cause, in
                particular to create personalized advertising offers.

            <div class="sub_text gradient-text">To the attention of Ukrainian security officers: the inspection was
                conducted online,
                without searches,
                without seizure of servers or <br> other visible interference for business. And so it was possible.

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>In the case of personalization of advertising, Google was sure to obtain the consent of users,
                because, firstly, when creating Google accounts, the user agrees to the Privacy Policy, and
                secondly, Google has a section "Ads personalization", where you can disable this feature.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>However, CNIL does not think so, because the information about the personalization of advertising is
                    not clear enough to users. As an example, the Commission claims that the relevant "Personalization"
                    window does not contain information on the full range of Google services that collect and process
                    personal data for this purpose (YouTube, Google search, Play Store, Google pictures, Gmail, etc.).
                    ),
                    and therefore, the user cannot realize to what extent the data is used and how exactly they can be
                    combined.</p>

            <div class="container-four">
                <h3>So, let's walk through the text of the CNIL decision</h3>
                <p>Why France and not Ireland. Google operates in Europe through a legal entity in Ireland. But the case
                    was not initiated by the Irish, but by the French regulator. This is why it happened.</p>
                <p>If data processing decisions are taken anywhere outside the EU, there is a one-stop mechanism -
                    where the complaint is received, the body considers it. Because Google's data processing center is
                    located in the United States and the complaint was first received in France, CNIL considered it.</p>
